*Fullstack Js Application*

## Introduction
This application uses the MEAN stack in order to create web applications. In a first time, we'll create a blog app and we'll add functionalities afterwards.

## Development setup
Run `npm install` to load development tools dependencies inside the node_modules folder.

Run `bower install` to load the application's libraries (angular, bootstrap,...) inside the libs folder.

Run `npm run dev` to launch the local web server based on `server.js` entry point.
